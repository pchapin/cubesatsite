      <p>The goal of the Basic Low Earth Orbit (BasicLEO) project is to explore the technologies
        required for building a viable CubeSat use SPARK/Ada for the flight control software. This
        project's predecessor was the <b><a href="AlaskanIce.php">Alaskan Ice Buoy Project</a></b>
        that helped us learn about the <b><a href="http://www.cubesatkit.com">CubeSat Kit</a></b>
        hardware that is also being used in this project</p>

      <p>Our CubeSat was launched into low Earth orbit as part of NASA's <b><a

            IV</a></b> program on the Air Force ORS-3 mission. The launch vehicle was an Orbital

            Island</a></b>, VA, on November 19, 2013 (<b><a href="http://youtu.be/MxJOYt-RUIA">launch
            video</a></b>). The mission, still ongoing, has been a success! We have downloaded
        many <b><a

              height="200" class="alignleft"/>Our low Earth orbiting CubeSat re-entered Earth's
        atmosphere and burned up on November 21, 2015. This was two years and two days after its
        launch. We were able to successfully communicate with the spacecraft up until a few hours
        before its re-entry.</p>

      <p>Thanks to all of you who helped our effort by emailing packets to us! For the record: our
        down link frequency was 437.305 MHz, 9600 baud, FSK, AX.25. Our spacecraft has the
        International Designation 2013-064AD, also cataloged as NORAD 39407U.</p>

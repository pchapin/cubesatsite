      <p>The CubeSat Laboratory at <b><a href="https://www.vermontstate.edu/">Vermont State
            University</a></b> (VTSU) is a collection of students, faculty, and staff building <b><b><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat">CubeSat</a></b></b> technology
        spacecraft.</p>

      <p>CubeSats are being constructed by many groups around the world, both inside and outside
        of academia, but what makes our work different is that we use the <b><a
              href="https://www.adacore.com/sparkpro">SPARK/Ada programming language</a></b>. As
        compared to the more commonly used C language, Ada makes it much easier to write robust
        software. SPARK adds the ability to create mathematical proofs (with the aid of tools)
        showing various correctness properties such as freedom from certain classes of runtime
        errors. Our BasicLEO CubeSat, launched in November 2013 is the first CubeSat programmed
        with Ada and the first spacecraft of any kind programmed with SPARK.</p>

      <p>This is the official web site for VTSU's CubeSat Laboratory providing information about
        all our missions, both in the past and ongoing. See the <b><a
              href="http://cubesatlab.blogspot.com/">Flying Sparks</a></b> blog for up to the
        minute information about our current work. To contact us, see the "People" section below.
